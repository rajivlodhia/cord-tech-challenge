# cord Frontend Tech Challenge

This challange was done with the older codebase as a starting point.

Starting from the old codebase, all packages were updated to the latest versions and the development server switched to Vite from create-react-app and react-scripts. The react-scripts package doesn't support Typescript versions >4 so it didn't make sense to use it. Components were also updated as well to .tsx files, and then to functional components from class components.

As per the instructions, the homepage is left blank and all the functionality is on the `/discover` route. You can get there by navigating to the discover page in the left navigation sidebar.

## Quick Start Guide

1.  Navigate to the project directory in the terminal
2.  Run `npm install` or `npm i` to install all the necessary packages
3.  Run `npm run dev` to start a development server
4.  Click on the localhost URL provided by Vite in the terminal. It should be something like `http://localhost:5173/`
